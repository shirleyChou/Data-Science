## The goal of NLP
For computers to process or **understand** natural language in order to perform tasks that are useful, e.g.

*  Question Answering

Fully understanding and representing the meaning of language (or even defining it) is and illusive goal.


## NLP in industry
* Search (written and spoken)
* Online advertisement (Understand language)
* Automated/assisted translation
* Sentiment analysis for marketing or finance/trading
* Speech recognition
* Automating customer support


## What's Deep Learning
* It is a subfield of machine learning
* Most machine learning methods work well because of human-designed representations and input features.
* Machine learning becomes just optimizing weights to best make a final prediction.
* Representation learning attempts to automatically learn good features or representations.
* The dominant model family inside deep learning is neural networks. 


## Reasons for Exploring Deep Learning 
* Manually designed features are often over-specified, incomplete and take a long time to design and validate
* **Learned Features** are easy to adapt, fast to learn. 
* Deep learning provides a very flexible, (almost?) universal, learnable framework for representing world, visual and linguisgic information.
* Deep learning can learn unsupervised (from raw text) and supervised (with specific labels like positive/negative)
* DL techniques benefit more from a lot of data.
